CSC 411 MINI PROJECT

The CSC 411 Assignment Github repository contains three Python programs titled Consumer_Producer.py, server.py, and client.py.

Consumer_Producer.py:
This Python program contains code to implement the consumer-producer problem explained in part one of the mini-project briefs.

server.py and client.py:
The following Python programs contain code to implement the producer-consumer problem using socket programming.

How to Run the Programs:
In order to run these Python programs, the following steps must be followed:

1. Download the code as a zip folder into a folder of your choice on your computer.
   
3. Unzip the folder, then open the unzipped folder.
   
4. Search for cmd on the toolbar of the unzipped folder, then hit Enter.
   
5. A command prompt will open your screen, once this screen appears, enter the following command: python program_name.py
For example, if you wish to run the Consumer_Producer program, you would type: python Consumer_Producer.py

This will implement the consumer producer problem in the file.
   
6. To implement the problem using socket programming, you will first need to run the server program in the command prompt by entering: python server.py
   
8.  Once the server is running, open another instance of the command prompt by searching for cmd in the toolbar of the unzipped folder
   
10. When the instance appears on the screen, run the client.py program by entering the command: python client.py, you will be requested to enter a command to either produce ( which means you are serving as a producer for that instance ) or to consume.
    
12. Make sure the server program is still running in the command prompt for these requests to be accepted and implemented using sockets
